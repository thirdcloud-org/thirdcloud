## Increase Efficiency, Reduce Costs

ThirdCloud helps you work smarter by bringing your tools and data together.

- ☝️**One Platform**: Use all your tools in one place—no need to switch apps.
- 🤝 **Easy Teamwork**: Collaborate smoothly, wherever your team is.
- 🤹 **Adaptable Workflows**: Customize it to fit how your team works best.

## Third-party Apps

Each third-party app runs in an isolated sandbox with limited access to the DOM and Web APIs. They are given the same level of performance and accessibility as ThirdCloud itself.

- 🛠️ **Built with Familiar Technology**: Vanilla JS, React, Vite, and more. We focus on providing a great developer experience. For more information, see [Build Your First App](./docs/BUILD_YOUR_FIRST_APP.md).
- 🔋 **Batteries included**: Built-in features like authentication, real-time updates, analytics & enterprise data models.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> ThirdCloud is in beta phase. The security layer has not safeguarded all Web APIs.

## Getting Started

1. **Development**:

   ```sh
   bun i # or npm i
   bun dev
   ```

2. **Production**:

   ```sh
   bun run build

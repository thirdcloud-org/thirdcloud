## Increase Efficiency, Reduce Costs

ThirdCloud streamlines your tools and improves data flow, saving you time and resources. Say goodbye to software bloat and data silos.

- **Unified Platform**: All your essential tools in one place—no more switching between apps.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Work with your team seamlessly, wherever they are.
- **Flexible Workflows**: Adapt ThirdCloud to fit your team’s unique needs.

## Third-party apps

- **Built with Familiar Technology**: Vanilla JS, React, Vite, and more. We focus on providing a great developer experience. For more information, see [Build Your First App](./docs/BUILD_YOUR_FIRST_APP.md).
- **Battery included**: Think authentication, real-time features, data management, and caching.

## Performance

Third-party apps are **secured** and **lightning fast**. Each app runs in an isolated sandbox with limited access to the DOM and Web APIs. They are given the same level of performance and accessibility as ThirdCloud itself.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> ThirdCloud is still a work in progress. The security layer is implemented but has not safeguarded all Web APIs.

## Getting Started

1. **Development**:

   ```sh
   bun i # or npm i
   bun dev
   ```

2. **Production**:

   ```sh
   bun run build
   # your app is ready to serve in the output folder
   ```
